Description:Wrote a few lines of code for the Respond function in pageserver.py. First thing was to extract the file from the URL request and to make sure it did not have any illegal characters. After this you have to make sure the file exists and once that is confirmed transmit the contents of the file using file IO. All of this is done while implementing the correct error status and messages.
